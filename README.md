# Keeper App

Keeper is a user-friendly note-taking application developed using React. It offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to create, view, and manage their notes efficiently.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Add new notes with a dedicated title and content section.
- **View Notes**: All notes are displayed on the main page for easy access.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes that are no longer needed.

The repository is structured as follows:

- `backend/`: Contains all the backend code with `server.js` as the entry point.
  - `models/`: Includes Mongoose schemas defining the structure of the notes.

- The root directory contains the frontend React application code.
